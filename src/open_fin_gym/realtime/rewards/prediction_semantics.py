"""Curated prediction-array semantics for the reward bank.

Each curated metric class enforces a particular interpretation of the
agent's ``predictions`` array (and, for trading metrics, of the per-trade
dicts the runner builds from agent actions). Bundling those interpretations
here lets the Phase-4 instruction.md renderer give the agent an
unambiguous, per-metric "what should each entry of `predictions` mean?"
sentence — driven by the manifest's ``resolved_reward_names`` list, with
no LLM paraphrasing.

For Phase-3-generated reward classes (those that live in the per-task
``task_rewards.py`` rather than the curated bank), the renderer falls
back to the class's own docstring (extracted via AST). Only the curated
classes — whose contracts are stable across tasks — have entries here.

Each entry is a short prose string (1-3 sentences). It MUST describe:
  * what each entry of the agent's emitted array represents (return,
    level, probability, sample, embedding, ...),
  * any required shape/distribution constraint
    (e.g. ``CRPSLoss`` needs samples, not a point estimate;
    ``EmbeddingFID`` needs embeddings via ``fake_emb`` ctx kwarg).

Update this map whenever a new class is added to ``reward_bank.py`` —
the assembled-evaluator task code-gen pipeline reads it at render time.
