"""RealtimeForecastingTask — ForecastingTask subclass for realtime / deferred-eval.

This task is fundamentally a forecasting task, not a trading task: the
agent submits directional predictions (``long``/``short`` + confidence)
and ground truth is resolved asynchronously by the :class:`ResolverService`
after the prediction horizon has elapsed. No orders are executed, no
portfolio state is maintained.

Data flows as Python objects in-memory (no file I/O on the hot path).

* ``reset()``   — fetches a fresh market snapshot via the data provider.
* ``step()``    — records the agent's prediction in the ledger and returns
                  the next market snapshot.  The step reward is always 0
                  because ground truth is not yet available.
* ``evaluate()`` — returns deferred-status metadata.  Actual rewards are
                   computed later by the :class:`ResolverService`.

    The agent produces directional / price predictions; ground truth is
    deferred until the resolver service fetches the exit price after
    the prediction horizon elapses. Inherits :class:`ForecastingTask`
    because the interaction model is prediction, not sequential
    trading. ``batch_mode = False`` — each :meth:`step` submits one
    independent prediction (standard gym loop, not batch ``act``).

    Parameters:

    - ``provider``: data backend (Binance, Alpaca, ...).
    - ``ledger``: :class:`PredictionLedger` for deferred evaluation.
    - ``symbols``: input symbols in every observation.
    - ``horizon_bars``: how far ahead the agent predicts, in bars of the
      primary (``data_resolution``) interval. The exit price is the close
      of the bar ``horizon_bars`` after the bar containing submission —
      so resolution granularity follows ``data_resolution`` (1m bars →
      minute-close target; 1d bars → daily-close target).
    - ``context_resolutions``: non-empty list of
      ``{"interval": str, "bars": positive int}`` entries. Sidecar
      resolutions (anything other than ``data_resolution``) are
      derived by **downsampling from the primary buffer** at observation
      time — no extra fetch or WebSocket sub. The REST primer depth
      auto-scales to span the deepest sidecar window.
    - ``data_resolution``: which entry's interval drives the primary
      buffer + REST stream + entry-price snapshots. Required when 2+
      entries are given. **Must be the finest** interval (sidecars are
      downsampled from it; no upsampling). This controls data buffering
      and obs cadence only — agents step at whatever frequency they
      want; ``data_resolution`` does not pace the gym loop.
    - ``target_symbols``: subset scored by the resolver (default = all
      symbols). Predictions for out-of-set symbols are dropped at
      :meth:`step` with a warning.
